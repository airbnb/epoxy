# A script to update processor test files in the "src/test/resources" package with the latest test output.
# This is useful when changes are made to the annotation processor and all the tests need to have their expected values updated.
#
# You may have to run this multiple times for the tests that output several generated source files.
# In those cases the test report only details the first failure, so you will have to run `./gradlew test`
# again to generate a new test report before running this script again.

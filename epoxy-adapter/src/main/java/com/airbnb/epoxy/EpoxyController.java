 * <p>
 * The controller maintains a {@link android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter} with the latest
 * models, which you can get via {@link #getAdapter()} to set on your RecyclerView.
 * <p>
 * All data change notifications are applied automatically via Epoxy's diffing algorithm. All of
 * your models must have a unique id set on them for diffing to work. You may choose to use {@link
 * AutoModel} annotations to have the controller create models with unique ids for you
 * automatically.
 * <p>
 * Once a model is created and added to the controller in {@link #buildModels()} it should be
 * treated as immutable and never modified again. This is necessary for adapter updates to be
 * accurate.

# Epoxy

Epoxy is an Android library for building complex screens in a RecyclerView. It abstracts the boilerplate of view holders, item types, item ids, span counts, and more, in order to simplify building screens with multiple view types. Additionally, Epoxy adds support for saving view state and automatic diffing of item changes.

[We developed Epoxy at Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/epoxy-airbnbs-view-architecture-on-android-c3e1af150394#.xv4ymrtmk) to simplify the process of working with RecyclerViews, and to add the missing functionality we needed. We now use Epoxy for most of the main screens in our app and it has improved our developer experience greatly.

## Installation

Gradle is the only supported build configuration, so just add the dependency to your project `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.airbnb.android:epoxy:2.0.0'
}
```

Optionally, if you want to use the [attributes for generated helper classes](#annotations) you must also provide the annotation processor as a dependency.
```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.airbnb.android:epoxy:2.0.0'
  annotationProcessor 'com.airbnb.android:epoxy-processor:2.0.0'
}
```

## Basic Usage

Create a class that extends `EpoxyController` and implement `buildModels` to specify which models to add, and in what order.  Call `EpoxyController#getAdapter()` to get the backing adapter to add to your `RecyclerView`. Call `requestModelBuild` on the controller whenever your data changes and you would like the models to be rebuilt.

Create `EpoxyModels` to specify how your data is bound to views. Epoxy will handle inflating your views and binding them to your models.

As an example, our `PhotoController` shows a header, a list of photos, and a loader (if more photos are being loaded). The controller's `setData(photos, loadingMore)` method is called whenever photos are loaded, which triggers a call to `buildModels` so models representing the state of the new data can be built. After models are rebuilt, Epoxy notifies the RecyclerView of any changes between the previous models and the new models. Epoxy manages creating new views and binding them to the corresponding model when necessary.

```java
public class PhotoController extends Typed2EpoxyController<List<Photo>, Boolean> {
    @AutoModel HeaderModel_ headerModel;
    @AutoModel LoaderModel_ loaderModel;

    @Override
    protected void buildModels(List<Photo> photos, Boolean loadingMore) {
      headerModel
          .title("My Photos")
          .addTo(this);

      for (Photo photo : photos) {
        add(new PhotoModel(photo));
      }

      loaderModel
          .addIf(loadingMore);
    }
  }
```
